#  GSoC2020 @Arduino - Writing MicroPython Examples and Tools for Portenta 

## Abstract

_I plan to work on writing MicroPython examples for the Arduino Portenta board and also document working hardware prototypes on the project hub with the help of the board sent by the organization.
I will incorporate interfacing with the board, some popular sensors and actuators, followed by some building interactive project prototypes using these. I will be documenting all of my goals on the project hub._


## Technical Details

_Long description of the project. **Must** include all technical details of the
projects, like libraries involved._

_Here you can show relevant pieces of code that you want to change. You can
link to literature you used during the research._

## Schedule of Deliverables

### **Community Bonding Period**

1. _Getting started with Arduino Portenta Board and begin with exploring different features of the board. Get familiar with the new board and the community that I will be working with the whole summer._
1. _Installing MicroPython on the board and setting up the MicroPython REPL prompt for several examples and projects to be developed further._
