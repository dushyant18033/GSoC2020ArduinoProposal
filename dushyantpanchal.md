#  GSoC2020 @Arduino - Writing MicroPython Examples and Tools for Portenta 

## Abstract

I plan to work on writing MicroPython examples for the Arduino Portenta board and also document working hardware prototypes on the project hub with the help of the board sent by the organization.
I will incorporate interfacing with the board, some popular sensors and actuators, followed by some building interactive project prototypes using these. I will be documenting all of my goals on the project hub.


## Technical Details

_Long description of the project. **Must** include all technical details of the
projects, like libraries involved._

_Here you can show relevant pieces of code that you want to change. You can
link to literature you used during the research._

## Schedule of Deliverables

_Here should come a list of your milestones. This list is a start based on the
difference phases of GSoC. Use it as a start. You can/should add more details
for each phase by breaking it down into weeks or set specific targets for each
phase. Each target should be split into sub task with a time estimate, [work
breakdown structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_breakdown_structure) are helpful here._

### **Community Bonding Period**

_What will you do during the community bonding period?_

### **Phase 1**

* Deliverable 1
* Deliverable 2

### **Phase 2**

* Deliverable 1
* Deliverable 2
* ...

### **Final Week**

_At this stage you should finish up your project. At this stage you should make
sure that you have code submitted to your organization. Our criteria to mark
your project as a success is to submit code before the end of GSoC._

## Development Experience

_Do you have code on GitHub? Can you show previous contributions to other projects?
Did you do other code related projects or university courses?_

_Do you have experience with Arduino?_
