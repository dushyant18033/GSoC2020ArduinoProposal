## Abstract

_I plan to work on writing MicroPython examples for the Arduino Portenta board and also document working hardware prototypes on the project hub with the help of the board sent by the organization.
I will incorporate interfacing with the board, some popular sensors and actuators, followed by some building interactive project prototypes using these. I will be documenting all of my goals on the project hub._



## Schedule of Deliverables

### **Community Bonding Period: Getting Started with Portenta and the Community**

##### _I am planning to spend the 4-week community bonding period as follows:-_

* _Getting started with Arduino Portenta Board and begin with exploring different features of the board. Get familiar with the new board and the community that I will be working with the whole summer._
* _Installing MicroPython on the board and setting up the MicroPython REPL prompt for several examples and projects to be developed in the subsequent weeks._
* _I will first of all try to find analogy between my NodeMCU MicroPython experience and the new Portenta MicroPython by trying to build an RGB LED lamp on Portenta. (I have already built it using esp8266.)_
* _Planning to start with the Phase 1 work early to finish my goals before the deadline and if I am able to finish early, I will use this time in developing a PID-based self-balancing bot using Portenta and MPU6050 provided the time permits me to do so._

## Development Experience

_I have more than 3 years of experience working with Arduino UNO and have worked on many interactive projects including an Arduino-based firmware for quadcopter flight control (still under development), a self-balancing bot, a HelpCap (a cap-like device that can emulate mouse events on specific head movements connected to the PC via BlueTooth) which was also selected among the best projects in my college course project showcase. I have also worked with nodeMCU (both via MicroPython and Arduino IDE). I also have good enough experience with Python Programming. Following is the link to my github profile where I've put various projects that I have developed during my college courses. I assure you that this is going to be more of a passion for me than work since I started working with Arduino as a hobby during my class 10th days._

## Why this project?

_I started programming and tinkering with Arduino during my school days when one of my friends gifted me an Arduino Uno on my 16th birthday. It has been 4 years and I still love tinkering around with projects involving arduino and similar microcontroller and simple electronics. While I was searching for an organisation to apply to for GSoC2020, and I got a glimpse on Arduino, I had my final decision that I will only apply for this organisation and none other since I'll get to work on and learn from something that is my hobby. And nothing is more interesting to do than your hobby. Thus it is my complete assurance to be fully committed towards this project._



## Do you have any other commitments during the GSoC period?

_I will be having end semester examinations for a week or two sometime in June/July as the college had to be closed due to CoronaVirus circumstances. But I commit to cover up the back log that might happen during this time by working for longer hours after my examination is over. Rest of the time I will be fully committed._
