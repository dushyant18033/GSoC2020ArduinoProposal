## Abstract

_I plan to work on writing MicroPython examples for the Arduino Portenta board and also document working hardware prototypes on the project hub with the help of the board sent by the organization.
I will incorporate interfacing with the board, some popular sensors and actuators, followed by some building interactive project prototypes using these. I will be documenting all of my goals on the project hub._



## Schedule of Deliverables

### **Community Bonding Period: Getting Started with Portenta and the Community**

* _Getting started with Arduino Portenta Board and begin with exploring different features of the board. Get familiar with the new board and the community that I will be working with the whole summer._
* _Installing MicroPython on the board and setting up the MicroPython REPL prompt for several examples and projects to be developed further._


### **Phase 1: Basic Sensors and Actuators**

* _Various interactive projects using LEDs_
  * Blinking/Fading an LED
  * Working with an RGB LED
  * 5x4 LED matrix
  * 2x2x2 LED cube
* _Working with ADC to read various analog sensors_
  * Potentiometer
  * Light Dependent Resistor
  * Thermistor
  * Analog Sound Sensor
* _Working with some digital sensors_
  * Push Button, Debouncing and Interrupts
  * IR Motion Sensor, IR Proximity Sensor
  * HC SR04 Ultrasonic Distance Sensor
  * Capacitive Touch Sensor
* _Working with the following 4 kinds of motors_
  * Servo Motor PWM control.
  * DC motor via L293D h-bridge motor driver IC with PWM based speed control.
  * Stepper motor via ULN2003 stepper motor driver.
  * BLDC motor PWM speed control via an ESC.
* _Building a Line Follower Robot using IR proximity sensors and DC motors._
* _Building an Obstacle Avoiding Robot using IR proximity sensors/Ultrasonic distance sensor+Servo motor and DC motors._


### **Phase 2: Three Important Communication Protocols - UART,I2C,SPI**

* _Interfacing with the HC05 Bluetooth module through the UART communication protocol._
* _Building a Bluetooth Based Remote Control Robot using HC05 and DC motors._
* _Interfacing with Accelerometer+Gyroscope sensor MPU6050 through the I2C communication protocol._
* _Building an AirMouse using MPU6050 and Bluetooth._
* _Interfacing with MFRC522 RFID reader through the SPI communication protocol._
* _Building a simple RFID authenticator using the MFRC522 RFID reader._
* Also Exploring Some Additional Features
  * _Working with the Portenta built-in Bluetooth peripheral module._
  * _Working with the Portenta built-in WiFi peripheral module._


### **Final Week: Finishing and Submission**

* _Implementing a Proportional-Integral-Derivative Algorithm on the Portenta._
* _Cover up any backlog or incomplete work._
* _Submit the work._



## Development Experience

_I have more than 3 years of experience working with Arduino UNO and have worked on many interactive projects including an Arduino-based firmware for quadcopter flight control (still under development), a self-balancing bot, a HelpCap (a cap-like device that can emulate mouse events on specific head movements connected to the PC via BlueTooth) which was also selected among the best projects in my college course project showcase. I have also worked with nodeMCU (both via MicroPython and Arduino IDE). I also have good enough experience with Python Programming. Following is the link to my github profile where I've put various projects that I have developed during my college courses. I assure you that this is going to be more of a passion for me than work since I started working with Arduino as a hobby during my class 10th days._

## Why this project?

_I started programming and tinkering with Arduino during my school days when one of my friends gifted me an Arduino Uno on my 16th birthday. It has been 4 years and I still love tinkering around with projects involving arduino and similar microcontroller and simple electronics. While I was searching for an organisation to apply to for GSoC2020, and I got a glimpse on Arduino, I had my final decision that I will only apply for this organisation and none other since I'll get to work on and learn from something that is my hobby. And nothing is more interesting to do than your hobby. Thus it is my complete assurance to be fully committed towards this project._



## Do you have any other commitments during the GSoC period?

_I will be having end semester examinations for a week or two during the community bonding period. But I commit to cover up the back log that might happen during this time by working for longer hours after my examination is over. Rest of the time I will be fully committed._
